# Dropdown fun

-Helping a friend with some updates to his website and we wanted to add a dropdown feature for services he offers. 

-Got the dropdown working but couldn't animate the arrow to point down once the dropdown was open. 

-Built this standalone feature to troubleshoot the issue and discovered it was because the default display was "block" and that prevented the transform effect from happening. 

-Changed the display to inline-block and that allowed for the tranform effect to work!

## Usage

-Clone the repo and GoLive to check out the feature. 

-Look at that beautiful arrow move!
